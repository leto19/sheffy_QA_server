The '''University of Sheffield Medical School''' is a [[Medical school (United Kingdom)|medical school]] based at the [[University of Sheffield]] in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], England. The school traces its history back to at least 1828. It operated independently until its merger with Firth College and Sheffield Technical School in 1897, and is now an integral part of Sheffield's Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health.

The medical school consists of four academic and research departments, which are Academic Unit of Medical Education; Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease; Neuroscience; and Oncology and Metabolism,<ref></ref> and is active in three fields of medicine: [[Medical education|teaching]], [[medical research|researching]] and [[Medicine#Practice|practising]].

Sheffield was ranked 12th in the UK in clinical, pre-clinical and health in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2020.<ref></ref> As of 2020, its five-year [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBChB]] programme admits 273 home students and a further 18 overseas students per year.<ref name="admissions"></ref> It is a founding member of the [[University Clinical Aptitude Test|UCAT]] consortium<ref></ref> and one of 32 bodies entitled by the [[General Medical Council]] to award medical degrees in the UK.<ref name="GMC"></ref>

==History==
===First medical school in Sheffield===

Surgeon [[apothecary]] Hall Overend started medical teaching in Sheffield as early as 1811.<ref name="History"></ref> Medical training was then unstructured due to apprenticeship until the [[Apothecaries Act 1815]] came into force. The act empowered the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|Society of Apothecaries]] in London to regulate medical profession throughout England and Wales, as well as to award licence to practise, the Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries (LSA). Although Overend was never registered with the Society of Apothecaries as a lecturer, he began to develop his own School of Practical Anatomy and Medicine in Sheffield,<ref></ref> which became the oldest higher education establishment in the city, and one of the earliest English medical schools outside London.<ref name="Overend"></ref> The school received external recognition in 1828, when its teachers were formally registered with the society. Overend taught with examples illustrating natural history, anatomy, pathology and chemistry. He also conducted demonstrations of dissection at his Church Street home, in an anatomy museum that was converted from a [[malt house]].<ref name="Overend"/> The cadavers used for teaching human anatomy in his school were illegally provided by [[Resurrectionists in the United Kingdom|resurrectionists]], which was common in the 19th century.<ref name="Overend"/> Overend presented his apprentices for the LSA since 1815 and seven of them had successfully passed the examination between 1816 and 1826.<ref></ref> Hall Overend's son, Wilson Overend, also qualified as a lecturer with the Society of Apothecaries in 1828.<ref name="History"/>

In the late 1820s, physicians and surgeons of the [[Sheffield Royal Infirmary|Sheffield General Infirmary]], the first hospital in the city, stated that a medical school connected with a public hospital would have greater eligibility for recognition by the Society of Apothecaries, compared with one that run by private individuals.<ref name="History"/> Arnold James Knight, a physician at the infirmary, made a motion to found a public medical school in Sheffield in 1828, which was seconded by Hall Overend.<ref name="Overend"/> Wilson Overend took over ownership of his father's medical school at the beginning of 1829, since his father transferred his support to the new school. Wilson continued his school as Sheffield School of Anatomy and Medicine at the corner house between Eyre Street and Charles Street,<ref></ref> until was burnt down in 1835 following a riot;<ref name="History"/> the wife of the caretaker of the premises shouted out "murder" when the alleged drunk caretaker and his friend proceeded to beat her.<ref></ref> The crowd misinterpreted the noise as the men were attempting to murder or [[Burke and Hare murders|burke]] the woman, broke into the building and set fire.<ref name="Timeline"></ref>

===Independent medical school===
[[File:Arnold Knight.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Sir Arnold Knight founded the Sheffield Medical Institution in 1829.]]

The new medical school was formally opened as the Sheffield Medical Institution on 2 July 1829 at the end of Surrey Street.<ref></ref> Knight laid the foundation stone in 1829 and gave an opening lecture describing the systematic programme of medical education.<ref name="Knight"/> Operated in a similar way to Hall Overend's school, the Sheffield Medical Institution was however corporately owned and provided facilities for doctors who were already in practice.<ref></ref><ref name="Overend"/> It had a lecture room with 100 seats, a dissecting room and a museum with library.<ref name="History"/> The teachers for the institution were unpaid and were drawn from the consultants at the General Infirmary, as well as at the [[Sheffield Royal Hospital|Public Dispensary]] (founded in 1832 also by Knight).<ref name="Knight"></ref> The Sheffield Medical Institution was renamed Sheffield Medical School in 1865, and in 1868 the Sheffield School of Medicine.<ref name="Timeline"/> Mariano Alejo Martin de Bartolomé was President of the Medical School for 22 years since 1866. Throughout the 19th century, the medical school collaborated with the [[Sheffield Children's Hospital]] and [[Jessop Hospital for Women]] to provide all the medical teaching.<ref name="History"/>

The school struggled to survive and was near to closure twice in 1865 and 1882.<ref name="History"/> This was caused by the resignation of the lecturers and the difficulty of recruiting new ones. There was also competition for public funds between the school and other local hospitals (including the specialist [[Lodge Moor Hospital]] and newly-founded [[Northern General Hospital|Northern General]] and [[Nether Edge Hospital|Nether Edge]] hospitals).<ref name="History"/> Firth College, established in 1879 by [[Mark Firth]], saved the medical school from collapse by taking over the teaching of all preliminary science subjects to medical students.<ref name="Historical note"></ref> The two local institutions hence became intertwined. In 1883, the Mayor of Sheffield and the [[Master Cutler]] (an ambassador of industry in Sheffield) appealed to the public for funds to build a new medical school building to replace the original one in Surrey Street,<ref name=Legacy></ref> leading to the relocation of the Sheffield School of Medicine in 1888 from Surrey Street to a new premises on Leopold Street, opposite Firth College.<ref name="Timeline"/> The new building contained classrooms, a tiered lecture theatre, a dissecting room, a library and a museum.<ref name="Timeline"/>

In late 19th century, Principal of Firth College [[William Mitchinson Hicks]] had an ideal to bring into Sheffield a university.<ref name="Hicks"></ref> The first stage to accomplishing this was the union the city's higher education institutions (the medical school, Firth College and the Sheffield Technical School) into one university college.<ref name="Hicks"/> In 1897, the merger of the three institutions resulted in the University College of Sheffield. The medical school became one of its departments.<ref name=history></ref>

===Medical School at the university===
[[File:Royal Hallamshire Hospital and 'B' Road, viewed from Glossop Road, Broomhill, Sheffield - geograph-3813556.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Hallamshire Hospital]] and the B Road entrance to the Medical School.]]

In 1905, the university college received its [[royal charter]] to become the University of Sheffield. Medicine was a founding faculty at the university, along with Arts, Pure Science and Applied Science. The Medical Faculty was moved from Leopold Street to the North Wing of [[Firth Court]], which was adjacent to Back Lane where bodies could be discreetly delivered to the dissecting room. The Medical School chose red as the colour of its academic hoods in 1908.<ref name="Timeline"/> [[Lydia Manley Henry]], enrolled in 1909, was one of the first female students admitted to the Medical School. She graduated MBChB in 1916 and was awarded an [[Doctor of Medicine |MD]] later in 1920.<ref name ="Henry"></ref>
 
The Medical School moved in 1973 to its current building on Beech Hill Road, adjacent to the [[Royal Hallamshire Hospital]]. Overend is now regarded as the father of medical education in Sheffield.<ref></ref> The School of Medicine was renamed the Medical School and in 2001 School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences,<ref></ref><ref></ref> offering medicine MBChB and orthoptics BMedSci degree courses.<ref></ref> The school changed its name back to the Medical School in 2011,<ref></ref> and later the orthoptics course moved to the Health Sciences School of the university.<ref></ref>

==Academics==
===Teaching===
The standard undergraduate Medicine course is a five-year programme leading to an MBChB (''Medicinae Baccalaureus Chirurgiae Baccalaureus'') degree.<ref name="admissions"/> The course is divided into four phases. The structure of Phase 1 (first year) follows the General Medical Council's guidelines and focuses on the structure and function of the human body. Phase 2a (second year) starts with a six-week research project followed by training in procedural clinical skills in simulation. In Phase 2b (first half of third year), students undertake a three-week introduction to basic clinical skills and a 12-week longitudinal integrated clinical placement in one of the Sheffield's teaching hospitals. Phase 3 (second half of third year and fourth year) is clinically based. Phase 4 (final year) consists of a series of lectures and two longitudinal integrated placements in a different hospital and clinical area from Phase 2b.<ref></ref> The school also runs a four-year graduate entry Medicine MBChB programme for graduates with a life sciences degree. Students on this course bypass Phase 1 of the five-year programme.<ref></ref> Sheffield Medical School is one of the few UK medical schools to teach anatomy via full body dissection of cadavers with a facilitator.<ref name=":0"></ref>

===Research===
The Medical School has currently 18 research themes, which are: bone and joint; cancer; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular disease; dementia; endocrinology; enhancing the potential of learners; functional neurology and epilepsy; genomic medicine and bioinformatics; imaging; immunity; infection; motor neuron disorders; Parkinson's disease; primary medical care; reproduction; social accountability; and translational neuropsychology.<ref></ref>

The school has been associated with a number of notable medical discoveries. In the 1920s, [[Edward Mellanby]]'s studies on [[rickets]] established that [[cod liver oil]] prevented the disease, which helped lead to its eradication. In the 1930s, Cecil Payne became the first to use [[Penicillin]] to effect a cure. Also in the 1930s, [[Sir Hans Krebs]] made significant advancements in the study of cellular energy, codifying his observations in the [[Krebs Cycle]], for which work he received a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1953.<ref name=history/>

==Motto and coat of arms==
[[File:Sheffield Medical School 2008.png|thumb|Crest of the school on the Medical School building]]
The motto of the Sheffield Medical School is ''[[Ars longa vita brevis]]'', a Latin translation of an aphorism from [[s:Aphorisms|''Aphorismi'']] by Greek physician [[Hippocrates]]. It translates in English as "Art is long, life is short", referring to the difficulty in acquiring and practising the art of medicine.<ref></ref> A stone carving bearing the motto was displayed on the Sheffield Medical Institution building on Surrey Street, from 1829 until the demolition of the building in 1965.<ref></ref> The original stone is now situated close to the entrance of the medical school on Beech Hill Road.

The coat of arms of the Sheffield Faculty of Medicine was granted by the [[College of Arms]] on 12 December 2003.<ref name="coa"/> It features elements from the [[University of Sheffield#Coat of arms|coat of arms]] of the University of Sheffield: the Crown of Success, two sheaves of arrows and the open books, as well as the azure background colour. The [[rod of Asclepius]] is centred on the shield.<ref></ref> It can be seen throughout the Medical School on its buildings. A variation of the crest is used by various Sheffield Medical Society sports teams.<ref></ref>

==Student life==
Representing over 2000 medical students on campus, Sheffield Medical Society (MedSoc) is the largest society at the [[University of Sheffield Students' Union]].<ref name=medsoc/> The MedSoc has 33 academic and non-academic sub-societies as well as its own sports teams.<ref></ref>
