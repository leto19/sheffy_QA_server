'''Sheffield''' is a [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[metropolitan borough]] in [[South Yorkshire]], England. The name derives from the [[River Sheaf]] which runs through the city. It is [[Historic counties of England|historically]] part of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] and some of its southern suburbs such as [[Mosborough]] were transferred from [[Derbyshire]] to the city council. It is situated  south-west of Rotherham,  east of [[Manchester]],  south of [[Leeds]] and  north of [[Nottingham]]. It is the largest settlement in South Yorkshire and also the second-largest city (by population) in Yorkshire.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

The city is in the eastern foothills of the [[Pennines]], and the valleys of the [[River Don, Yorkshire|River Don]] and its four tributaries, the [[River Loxley|Loxley]], the [[Porter Brook]], the [[River Rivelin|Rivelin]] and the [[River Sheaf|Sheaf]]. Sixty-one per cent of Sheffield's entire area is green space, and a third of the city lies within the [[Peak District]] [[national park]].<ref name="sheffgeog"></ref> There are more than 250 parks, woodlands and gardens in the city,<ref name="sheffgeog" /> which is estimated to contain around 4.5&nbsp;million trees.<ref name="GEO_treecount"></ref>

Sheffield played a crucial role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], with many significant inventions and technologies having developed in the city. In the 19th century, the city saw a huge expansion of its traditional cutlery trade, when [[stainless steel]] and [[crucible steel]] were developed locally, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population. Sheffield received its [[municipal charter]] in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in these industries in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area. The Yorkshire [[riding (division)|ridings]] became counties in their own right in 1889, the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] county was disbanded in 1974. The city then became part of the [[South Yorkshire]] county, this has been made up of separately governed [[unitary authorities]] since 1986.

The 21st century has seen extensive [[Urban renewal|redevelopment]] in Sheffield, along with other British cities.  Sheffield's [[gross value added]] (GVA) has increased by 60% since 1997, standing at £11.3&nbsp;billion in 2015. The economy has experienced steady growth averaging around 5% annually, greater than that of the broader region of Yorkshire and the Humber.<ref></ref>

The city has a long sporting heritage, and is home both to the world's oldest football club, [[Sheffield F.C.]],<ref name="celebration"></ref> and the world's oldest football ground, [[Sandygate (stadium)|Sandygate]]. Matches between the two professional clubs, [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], are known as the [[Steel City derby]]. The city is also home to the [[World Snooker Championship]], and the [[Sheffield Steelers]], the UK's first professional ice hockey team.

Sheffield had a population of 518,090 in the [[2011 Census for England and Wales|2011 census]], making it the second largest city in the [[Yorkshire and The Humber]] region. The [[Sheffield Urban Area|Sheffield Built-up Area]], of which the Sheffield sub-division is the largest part, had a population of 685,369 also including the town of [[Rotherham]]. The [[City of Sheffield|district borough]], governed from the city, had a population of  at the mid-2019 estimate, making it the [[List of English districts by population|]] most populous district in England. It is one of eleven English cities that make up the [[Core Cities Group]].<ref></ref>

==Etymology==
The name, ''Sheffield'', has its origins in Old English and derives from the name of a principal river in the city, the [[River Sheaf]]. This name, in turn, is a corruption of ''shed'' or ''sheth'', which refers to a ''divide'' or ''separation''.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The second half of the name Sheffield refers to a field, or forest clearing.<ref></ref> Combining the two words, it is believed that the name refers to an [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlement in a clearing by the confluence of the [[River Don, Yorkshire|River Don]] and River Sheaf.<ref name=VICKERS1></ref>

==History==


===Early history===
[[File:Ruins of Sheffield Manor 1819 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Lithograph drawing showing a large stately home in ruins|[[Sheffield Manor]] ruins as they appeared ]]
The area now occupied by the City of Sheffield is believed to have been inhabited since at least the late [[Upper Paleolithic]], about 12,800 years ago.<ref></ref> The earliest evidence of human occupation in the Sheffield area was found at [[Creswell Crags]] to the east of the city. In the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] the area became the southernmost territory of the [[Pennines|Pennine]] tribe called the [[Brigantes]]. It is this tribe who are thought to have constructed several hill forts in and around Sheffield.<ref name=VICKERS />

Following the departure of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been the southern part of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] kingdom of [[Elmet]], with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of [[Mercia]].<ref></ref> Gradually, [[Angles|Anglian]] settlers pushed west from the kingdom of [[Deira]]. A Britonnic presence within the Sheffield area is evidenced by two settlements called [[Wales, South Yorkshire|Wales]] and Waleswood close to Sheffield.<ref>The word ''Wales'' derives from the Germanic word ''[[Walhaz]]'', and was originally used by the Anglo-Saxons to refer to the native Britons. In reference to the villages of Wales and Waleswood, [[Sidney Oldall Addy|S.O. Addy]], in his ''A Glossary of Words Used in the Neighbourhood of Sheffield'', p. 274, states "The Anglo-Saxon invaders or settlers called the old inhabitants or aborigines of this country wealas, or foreigners." See also, "Welsh" in </ref> The settlements that grew and merged to form Sheffield, however, date from the second half of the first millennium, and are of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Danelaw|Danish]] origin.<ref name="VICKERS"></ref> In Anglo-Saxon times, the Sheffield area straddled the border between the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]]. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' reports that [[Eanred of Northumbria]] submitted to [[Egbert of Wessex]] at the hamlet of [[Dore, South Yorkshire|Dore]] (now a suburb of Sheffield) in 829,<ref>In an entry dated 827, the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' states "Egbert led an army against the Northumbrians as far as Dore, where they met him, and offered terms of obedience and subjection, on the acceptance of which they returned home" ([http://mcllibrary.org/Anglo/part2.html transcription] ). Most sources (for example Vickers, ''Old Sheffield Town'') state that the date given in the chronicle is incorrect, and that 829 is the more likely date for this event.</ref> a key event in the unification of the kingdom of England under the [[House of Wessex]].<ref></ref>

After the [[Norman conquest of England]], [[Sheffield Castle]] was built to protect the local settlements, and a small town developed that is the nucleus of the modern city.<ref></ref> By 1296, a market had been established at what is now known as [[Castle Square, Sheffield|Castle Square]],<ref></ref> and Sheffield subsequently grew into a small [[market town]].  In the 14th&nbsp;century, Sheffield was already noted for the production of [[Knife|knives]], as mentioned in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'',<ref>[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] in [[The Reeve's Prologue and Tale|The Reeve's Tale]] from his book ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' wrote: "Ther was no man, for peril, dorste hym touche.  A Sheffeld thwitel baar he in his hose.  Round was his face, and camus was his nose"</ref> and by the early 1600s it had become the main centre of [[cutlery]] manufacture in England outside London, overseen by the [[Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire]].<ref></ref> From 1570 to 1584, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], was imprisoned in Sheffield Castle and [[Sheffield Manor]].<ref></ref>

===Industrial Revolution===
[[File:'Owd Shevvield'.jpg|thumb|left|alt=19th century picture of Sheffield|Sheffield in the 19th century. The dominance of industry in the city is evident.]]
[[File:13th December 1940- Sheffield blitz - NARA - 196508.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Bombing in Sheffield during the Sheffield Blitz, WW2.|Sheffield was targeted heavily by the [[Luftwaffe]] during WW2, owing to the city's industrial importance. The bombing campaign became known as the [[Sheffield Blitz]].]]
During the 1740s, a form of the [[crucible steel]] process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of a better quality of steel than had previously been possible.<ref name="Tweedale1986"></ref> In about the same period, a technique was developed for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot to produce silver plating, which became widely known as [[Sheffield plate]].<ref></ref> These innovations spurred Sheffield's growth as an industrial town,<ref></ref> but the loss of some important export markets led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19th&nbsp;century. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a [[cholera]] epidemic that killed 402&nbsp;people in 1832.<ref name="VICKERS"/> The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19th&nbsp;century; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901.<ref name="VICKERS" /> The [[Sheffield and Rotherham Railway|Sheffield and Rotherham railway]] was constructed in 1838, connecting the two towns. The town was incorporated as a [[borough]] in 1842, and was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] by [[letters patent]] in 1893.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed on the outskirts of the town.

The collapse of the dam wall of one of these reservoirs in 1864 resulted in the [[Great Sheffield Flood]], which killed 270 people and devastated large parts of the town.<ref></ref> The growing population led to the construction of many back-to-back dwellings that, along with severe pollution from the factories, inspired [[George Orwell]] in 1937 to write: "Sheffield, I suppose, could justly claim to be called the ugliest town in the [[Old World]]".<ref></ref>
[[File:Women of steel.jpg|alt=Photo of the statue Women of Steel at barker's Pool, Sheffield|thumb|upright|The ''[[Women of Steel]]'' statue commemorates the women of Sheffield who worked in the city's steel industry during the First and Second World Wars.]]

===Blitz===

[[Great Depression|The Great Depression]] hit the city in the 1930s, but as international tensions increased and the [[Second World War]] became imminent; Sheffield's steel factories were set to work manufacturing weapons and ammunition for the war effort. As a result, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred on the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940, now known as the [[Sheffield Blitz]]. The city was protected by barrage balloons managed from RAF Norton.<ref></ref> More than 660&nbsp;lives were lost and many buildings were destroyed or left badly damaged, including the Marples Hotel, which was hit directly by a 500lb bomb, killing over 70 people.<ref></ref>

===Post-Second World War===
[[File:Parkhill2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Panorama of a brutalist housing estate|[[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill flats]], an example of 1950s and 1960s council housing estates in Sheffield]]
In the 1950s and 1960s, many of the city's slums were demolished, and replaced with housing schemes such as the [[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill flats]]. Large parts of the city centre were also cleared to make way for a new system of roads.<ref name="VICKERS"/> In February&nbsp;1962, the city was devastated by the [[Great Sheffield Gale]]; winds of up to  killed four people and damaged 150,000 houses, more than two-thirds of the city's housing stock at the time.<ref name="rmets"></ref> Increased automation and competition from abroad resulted in the [[steel crisis|closure of many steel mills]]. The 1980s saw the worst of this run-down of Sheffield's industries, along with those of many other areas of the UK.<ref></ref> The building of the [[Meadowhall Centre]] on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much-needed jobs but hastening the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started when the city hosted the 1991 [[Universiade|World Student Games]], which saw the construction of new sporting facilities such as the [[Sheffield Arena]], [[Don Valley Stadium]] and the [[Ponds Forge]] complex.<ref name="VICKERS"/>

===21st century===
[[File:Sheffield Peace Gardens (geograph 7124524).jpg|thumb|[[Peace Gardens]]]]
Sheffield is changing rapidly as new projects regenerate some of the more run-down parts of the city. One such, the ''Heart of the City Project'', has initiated a number of public works in the city centre: the [[Peace Gardens]] were renovated in 1998, the [[Millennium Galleries]] opened in April 2001, the [[Sheffield Winter Gardens|Winter Gardens]] were opened in May 2003, and a public space to link these two areas, the [[Millennium Square (Sheffield)|Millennium Square]], was opened in May 2006. Additional developments included the remodelling of [[Sheaf Square]], in front of the refurbished railway station. The square contains "The Cutting Edge", a sculpture designed by Si Applied Ltd<ref></ref> and made from Sheffield steel.

Sheffield was particularly hard hit during the [[2007 United Kingdom floods]] and the [[Winter of 2009-2010 in the United Kingdom|2010 'Big Freeze']]. Many landmark buildings such as Meadowhall and the [[Hillsborough Stadium]] flooded due to being close to rivers that flow through the city. In 2010, 5,000 properties in Sheffield were identified as still being at risk of flooding. In 2012 the city narrowly escaped another flood, despite extensive work by the Environment Agency to clear local river channels since the 2007 event. In 2014 Sheffield Council's cabinet approved plans to further reduce the possibility of flooding by adopting plans to increase water catchment on tributaries of the River Don.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> [[2019–20 United Kingdom floods#Sheffield|Another flood hit the city in 2019]], resulting in shoppers being contained in Meadowhall Shopping Centre.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Between 2014 and 2018, there were [[Sheffield tree felling protests|disputes]] between the city council and residents over the fate of the city's 36,000 highway trees. Around 4,000 highway trees have since been felled as part of the ‘Streets Ahead’ [[Private Finance Initiative]] (PFI) contract signed in 2012 by the city council, [[Amey plc]] and the [[Department for Transport]] to maintain the city streets.<ref></ref> The tree fellings have resulted in many arrests of residents and other protesters across the city even though most felled trees in the city have been replanted, including those historically felled and not previously replanted.<ref></ref> The protests eventually stopped in 2018 after the council paused the tree felling programme as part of a new approach developed by the council for the maintenance of street trees in the city.<ref></ref>

==Governance==

===Local authority===
[[File:Town Hall, Sheffield - geograph.org.uk - 1482121.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Sheffield Town Hall|[[Sheffield Town Hall]]]]
[[File:Sheffield Town Hall Council Chamber.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Sheffield Town Hall|The Council Chamber at Sheffield Town Hall]]
Sheffield is governed at the local level by [[Sheffield City Council]] and is led by Councillor Terry Fox (Assumed office
19 May 2021). It consists of 84&nbsp;councillors elected to represent 28&nbsp;[[ward (politics)|wards]]: three councillors per ward. Following the [[2019 Sheffield City Council election|2019 local elections]], the distribution of council seats is [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] 49, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] 26, the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] 8 and [[United Kingdom Independence Party|UKIP]] 1. The city also has a [[Lord Mayor of Sheffield|Lord Mayor]]; though now simply a ceremonial position, in the past the office carried considerable authority, with executive powers over the finances and affairs of the city council. The position of Lord Mayor is elected on an annual basis.

For much of its history the council was controlled by the Labour Party, and was noted for its [[left-wing politics|leftist]] sympathies; during the 1980s, when Sheffield City Council was led by [[David Blunkett]], the area gained the epithet the "[[People's Republic of South Yorkshire|Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire]]".<ref></ref> However, the Liberal Democrats controlled the Council between 1999 and 2001 and took control again from 2008 to 2011.

The majority of council-owned facilities are operated by independent charitable trusts. [[Sheffield International Venues]] runs many of the city's sporting and leisure facilities, including [[Sheffield Arena]] and the [[English Institute of Sport – Sheffield|English Institute of Sport]]. [[Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust|Museums Sheffield]] and the [[Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust]] take care of galleries and museums owned by the council.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

===Combined authority===

The city of Sheffield is part of the wider [[South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority]],  headed by mayor [[Dan Jarvis]]. The [[combined authority]] covers the former 1974–1986 [[South Yorkshire County Council]] area which functions either went to local or regional authorities. 

In 2004, as part of the ''Moving Forward: [[The Northern Way]]'' document,<ref name="Moving Forward:The Northern Way"></ref> city regions were created in a collaboration with the three northern [[Regional development agency|regional development agencies]]. These became independent [[Local Enterprise Partnership]]s in 2011.

The area's partnership retains the Sheffield City Region name, covering the South Yorkshire authorities, as well as [[Bolsover District]], [[Borough of Chesterfield]], [[Derbyshire Dales]], [[North East Derbyshire]] and [[Bassetlaw District]]. In 2014, the ''Sheffield City Region Combined authority'' was formed by the South Yorkshire [[local authorities]] with the other councils as non-constituent members and the partnership integrated with the authority structure. In September 2020, the authority changed to its current name.<ref></ref>

===Parliamentary Representation===
The city returns five members of parliament to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], with a sixth, the Member of Parliament for [[Penistone and Stocksbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Penistone and Stocksbridge]] representing parts of Sheffield and Barnsley.<ref></ref> The former Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] was an MP for Sheffield, representing [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]] from [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]] until he was unseated [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]], when the seat returned a Labour MP for the first time in its history.<ref></ref>

==Geography==

[[File:Rivelin Valley - geograph.org.uk - 171316.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Rivelin Valley|[[Rivelin Valley]]]]
[[File:Gleadless Valley view.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Rivelin Valley|[[Gleadless]] Valley, demonstrating the hilly terrain within the city]]
Sheffield is located at . It lies directly beside [[Rotherham]], from which it is separated largely by the [[M1 motorway]]. Although [[Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley|Barnsley Metropolitan Borough]] also borders Sheffield to the north, the town itself is a few miles further away. The southern and western borders of the city are shared with [[Derbyshire]]; in the first half of the 20th&nbsp;century Sheffield extended its borders south into Derbyshire, annexing a number of villages,<ref name="derbyshire_expansion"></ref> including [[Totley]], [[Dore, South Yorkshire|Dore]] and the area now known as [[Mosborough]] Townships. 

Sheffield is a geographically diverse city.<ref name="GEO_diverse"></ref> It nestles in the eastern foothills of the [[Pennines]],<ref></ref> between the main upland range and [[Peak District|Peak District National Park]] to the west, and the lower-lying [[South Yorkshire Coalfield]] to the east. This forms a natural amphitheatre created by several hills<ref name="number of hills">It is often stated that Sheffield is built on seven hills (for an example, see [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]''). However, [http://mdfs.net/Docs/Sheffield/Hills/ a study by J.G.Harston]  found there to be eight.</ref> and the confluence of five rivers: [[River Don, South Yorkshire|Don]], [[River Sheaf|Sheaf]], [[River Rivelin|Rivelin]], [[River Loxley|Loxley]] and [[Porter Brook|Porter]]. As such, much of the city is built on hillsides with views into the city centre or out to the countryside. Blake Street, in the S6 postcode area, is the third steepest residential street in England, with a gradient of 16.6°.<ref></ref>  Sheffield is England's highest city above sea level; the highest point being  near [[High Stones]] and [[Margery Hill]].<ref></ref> The city's lowest point is just  above sea level near [[Blackburn Meadows]].  However, 79% of the housing in the city is between  above sea level.<ref></ref>  This variation of altitudes across Sheffield has led to frequent claims, particularly among locals, that the city was built on Seven Hills. As this claim is disputed, it likely originated as a joke referencing the [[Seven Hills of Rome]].<ref></ref>

Estimated to contain around 4.5&nbsp;million trees,<ref name="GEO_treecount"/> Sheffield has more trees per person than any other city in Europe and is considered to be one of the greenest cities in England and the UK,<ref></ref><ref></ref> which was further reinforced when it won the 2005 [[Entente Florale]] competition. With more than 250 parks, woodlands and gardens, it has over 170&nbsp;woodlands (covering ), 78&nbsp;public parks (covering ) and 10&nbsp;public gardens. Added to the  of national park and  of water this means that 61% of the city is [[open space reserve|greenspace]]. Despite this, about 64% of Sheffield householders live further than  from their nearest greenspace, although access is better in less affluent neighbourhoods across the city.<ref name="sheffgeog" /><ref></ref> Sheffield also has a very wide variety of [[habitat]], comparing favourably with any city in the United Kingdom: urban, parkland and woodland, agricultural and arable land, moors, meadows and freshwater-based habitats. There are six areas within the city that are designated as [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in South Yorkshire|sites of special scientific interest]].<ref></ref>

The present city boundaries were set in 1974 (with slight modification in 1994), when the former [[county borough]] of Sheffield merged with [[Stocksbridge]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]] and two parishes from the [[Wortley Rural District]].<ref name="sheffgeog" /> This area includes a significant part of the countryside surrounding the main urban region. Roughly a third of Sheffield lies in the [[Peak District|Peak District National Park]]. No other English city had parts of a national park within its boundary,<ref></ref> until the creation in March 2010 of the [[South Downs National Park]], part of which lies within [[Brighton and Hove]].



===Climate===
Under the Köppen classification, Sheffield has a oceanic climate type (Cfb). Like the rest of the United Kingdom, the climate in Sheffield is generally [[temperate]]. The uplands of the [[Pennines]] to the west can create a cool, gloomy and wet environment, but they also provide shelter from the prevailing westerly winds, casting a "rain shadow" across the area.<ref name="Met NE England"></ref> Between 1971 and 2000 Sheffield averaged  of rain per year; December was the wettest month with  and July the driest with . July was also the hottest month, with an average maximum temperature of . The highest temperature ever recorded in the city of Sheffield was , on 25 July 2019.<ref></ref> The average minimum temperature in January and February was ,<ref></ref> though the lowest temperatures recorded in these months can be between , although since 1960, the temperature has never fallen below ,<ref></ref> suggesting that urbanisation around the Weston Park site during the second half of the 20th&nbsp;century may prevent temperatures below  occurring.

The coldest temperature to be recorded was  in 2010.<ref></ref> (Note: The official Weston Park Weather Station statistics, which can also be viewed at [[Sheffield Central Library]], has the temperature at , recorded on 20 December, and states that to be the lowest December temperature since 1981.) The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city of Sheffield at [[Weston Park, Sheffield|Weston Park]], since records began in 1882, is , registered in February 1895.<ref></ref> The lowest daytime maximum temperature in the city since records began is , also recorded in February 1895. More recently,  was recorded as a daytime maximum at Weston Park, on 20 December 2010 (from the Weston Park Weather Station statistics, which also can be viewed at Sheffield Central Library.) On average, through the winter months of December to March, there are 67 days during which ground frost occurs.<ref name="Met NE England" />



The Weston Park Weather station, established in 1882, is one of the longest running weather stations in the United Kingdom. It has recorded weather for more than 125 years, and a 2008 report showed that the climate of Sheffield is warming faster than it has at any time during this period, with 1990 and 2006 being the hottest years on record.<ref></ref> In collaboration with the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]], Sheffield developed a [[carbon footprint]] (based on 2004–05 consumption figures) of 5,798,361&nbsp;[[tonnes]] per year. This compares to the UK's total carbon footprint of 698,568,010&nbsp;tonnes per year. The factors with the greatest impact are housing (34%), transport (25%), consumer (11%), private services (9%), public services (8%), food (8%) and capital investment (5%).<ref></ref> Sheffield City Council has signed up to the [[10:10]] campaign.<ref name="planet"></ref>

===Green belt===

Sheffield is within a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, and is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns and areas in the [[Sheffield urban area|Sheffield built-up area]] conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref name="belt1"></ref><ref name="belt2"></ref> The main urban area and larger villages of the borough are exempt from the green belt area, but surrounding smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas are 'washed over' with the designation. A subsidiary aim of the green belt is to encourage recreation and leisure interests,<ref name="belt1"/> with many rural landscape features and facilities included.

===Subdivisions===

Sheffield is made up of many suburbs and neighbourhoods, many of which developed from villages or [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]] that were absorbed into Sheffield as the city grew.<ref name="VICKERS"/> These historical areas are largely ignored by the modern administrative and political divisions of the city; instead it is divided into 28&nbsp;electoral [[ward (politics)|wards]], with each ward generally covering 4–6&nbsp;areas.<ref></ref> These electoral wards are grouped into six [[United Kingdom constituencies|parliamentary constituencies]]. Sheffield is largely [[civil parishes in England|unparished]], but [[Bradfield, South Yorkshire|Bradfield]] and [[Ecclesfield]] have parish councils, and [[Stocksbridge]] has a town council.<ref></ref>

The [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] reported a resident population for Sheffield of 513,234, a 2% decline from the 1991 census.<ref name="Sheffield 2001"></ref> The city is part of the wider [[Sheffield urban area]], which had a population of 640,720.<ref name="SUA 2001"></ref> [[United Kingdom Census 2011|In 2011]] the racial composition of Sheffield's population was 84% [[White people|White]] (81% [[White British]], 0.5% [[Irish migration to Great Britain|White Irish]], 0.1% [[Gypsy (term)|Gypsy]] or [[Irish Traveller]], 2.3% [[Other White]]), 2.4% of [[Mixed (United Kingdom ethnicity category)|mixed race]] (1.0% White and Black Caribbean, 0.2% White and Black African, 0.6% White and Asian, 0.6% Other Mixed), 8% [[British Asian|Asian]] (1.1% [[British Indian|Indian]], 4% [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]], 0.6% [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]], 1.3% [[British Chinese|Chinese]], 1.0% Other Asian), 3.6% [[Black British|Black]] (2.1% African, 1% [[British African-Caribbean people|Caribbean]], 0.5% [[Other Black]]), 1.5% [[British Arab|Arab]] and 0.7% of other ethnic heritage.<ref></ref> In terms of religion, 53% of the population are Christian, 6% are Muslim, 0.6% are Hindu, 0.4% are Buddhist, 0.2% are Sikh, 0.1% are Jewish, 0.4% belong to another religion, 31% have no religion and 7% did not state their religion.<ref></ref> The largest [[quinary]] group is 20- to 24-year-olds (9%) because of the large university student population.<ref></ref>

The [[Industrial Revolution]] served as a catalyst for considerable population growth and demographic change in Sheffield. Large numbers of people were driven to the city as the [[cutlery]] and steel industries flourished. The population continued to grow until the mid-20th century, at which point, due to industrial decline, the population began to contract. However, by the early 21st century, the population had begun to grow once again.  

The population of Sheffield peaked in 1951 at 577,050, and has since declined steadily. However, the mid-2007 population estimate was 530,300, representing an increase of about 17,000 residents since 2001.<ref></ref>

Although a city, Sheffield is informally known as "the [[largest village in England]]",<ref name="BaldwinBottomsWalker" /><ref name="Binfield" /><ref name="BurgoyneClark" /> because of a combination of topographical isolation and demographic stability.<ref name="BaldwinBottomsWalker" /> It is relatively geographically isolated, being cut off from other places by a ring of hills.<ref name="Hampton" /><ref name="TaylorEvansFraser" /> Local folklore insists that, like Rome, Sheffield was built "on seven hills".<ref name="TaylorEvansFraser" /> The land surrounding Sheffield was unsuitable for industrial use,<ref name="BaldwinBottomsWalker" /> and now includes several protected [[green belt]] areas.<ref name="Mann" /> These topographical factors have served to restrict urban spread,<ref name="Mann" /> resulting in a relatively stable population size and a low degree of mobility.

[[Sidney Pollard]]'s analysis of the 1851 Census data caused him to describe Sheffield as "the most proletarian city in England" at the time, it has more people per 100,000 employed in manufacturing occupations (188 for Sheffield, as compared to 146 for Leeds) and fewer people per 100,000 employed in professional occupations (41 for Sheffield, as compared to 66 for Birmingham, and 43 for Leeds).{{dubious|date=July 2012}} He attributed this to the cutlery trade in the city, which was organised not on polarised Capital-versus-Labour lines, but as a complex network of contracts between cutlery workshops, craftsmen and merchants, whose positive influence on community cohesion and equality lasted through the rise of the steel industry in the city later in the 19th&nbsp; century. Even by 1981, social polarisation (as defined by the Census and Registrar-General) in Sheffield was far lower than in many other cities, with only 4% of the population having professional occupations, as opposed to 62% classified as skilled or unskilled manual laborers.<ref name=TaylorEvansFraser /> -->

[[File:St Pauls Place Sheffield.png|thumb|left|alt=St Paul's Tower, a new, mixed use development which forms part of the St Paul's Place development. In the top left corner is the Main St Paul's tower itself. Below it is the Tower 2, connected to the main tower but half the height. To the right is another office building in the same development. All have been completed within the last 5 years and represent some of the newest architecture in the city.|[[St Paul's Place]], 2010. [[St Pauls Tower|St Paul's Tower]], the tallest building in Sheffield, is in the centre. The St Paul's Place development constitutes a major redevelopment of the area and has attracted numerous large companies to the complex, such as [[DLA Piper]], [[PriceWaterHouseCoopers]] and [[Barclays]]. The [[Department for Education]] and the [[Department for Business, Innovation & Skills]] have also established a presence within St Paul's Place.]]After many years of decline, the Sheffield economy is going through a strong revival. The 2004 [[Barclays Bank]] Financial Planning study<ref></ref> revealed that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Hallam]] was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by [[Knight Frank]]<ref></ref> revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside London for office and residential space and rents during the second half of 2004. This can be seen in a surge of redevelopments, including the [[St Pauls Tower|City Lofts Tower]] and accompanying [[St Paul's Place]], [[Velocity Living]] and the Moor redevelopment,<ref></ref> the forthcoming [[New Retail Quarter|NRQ]] and the [[Sheffield Winter Gardens|Winter Gardens]], [[Peace Gardens]], [[Millennium Galleries]] and many projects completed under the [[Sheffield One]] redevelopment agency. The Sheffield economy grew from £5.6&nbsp;billion in 1997 (1997 [[Gross value added|GVA]])<ref></ref> to £9.2&nbsp;billion in 2007 (2007 GVA).<ref></ref>

The "UK Cities Monitor 2008" placed Sheffield among the top ten "best cities to locate a business today", the city occupying third and fourth places respectively for best office location and best new [[call centre]] location. The same report places Sheffield in third place regarding "greenest reputation" and second in terms of the availability of financial incentives.<ref></ref>

=== Heavy industries and metallurgy ===
Sheffield has an international reputation for metallurgy and steel-making.<ref>There are numerous sources showing the international reputation of Sheffield for metallurgy, and in particular steel and cutlery manufacture. Some examples are: the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], which begins its entry for ''Sheffield'', "The name of a manufacturing city of Yorkshire, famous for cutlery"; and the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', which in its entry for "Sheffield" states that by 1830 Sheffield had earned "recognition as the world centre of high-grade steel manufacture". [[David Hey]] in the preface to his 1997 book ''Mesters to Masters: A History of the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire.'' ([[Oxford University Press]], ) states "It (Sheffield) was known for its cutlery wares long before the incorporation of the [[Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire|Cutlers' Company]] in 1624, and long before it acquired an international reputation as the steel capital of the world."</ref> The earliest official record of cutlery production, for which Sheffield is particularly well known, is from 1297 when a tax return for 'Robert the Cutler' was submitted.<ref name="welcometosheffield.co.uk"></ref> A key reason for Sheffield's success in the production of cutlery lies in its geographic makeup. The abundance of streams in the area provided water power and the geological formations in the [[Hope Valley, Derbyshire|Hope Valley]], in particular, provided sufficient grit stones for grinding wheels.<ref name="welcometosheffield.co.uk" /> In the 17th century, the [[Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire]], which oversaw the booming cutlery industry in the area and remains to this day, was established and focused on markets outside the Sheffield area, leading to the gradual establishment of Sheffield as a respected producer of cutlery.<ref name="welcometosheffield.co.uk" /> this gradually developed from a national reputation into an international one.<ref name="welcometosheffield.co.uk" />

Playing a crucial role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], the city became an industrial powerhouse in the 18th century, and was dubbed "[[Steel City]]".<ref name="Steel BBC"></ref> Many innovations in these fields have been made in Sheffield, for example [[Benjamin Huntsman]] discovered the [[crucible technique]] in the 1740s at his workshop in [[Handsworth, South Yorkshire|Handsworth]].<ref></ref> This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by [[Henry Bessemer]]'s invention of the [[Bessemer converter]]. [[Thomas Boulsover]] invented [[Sheffield Plate]] (silver-plated copper) in the early 18th&nbsp;century.

[[Stainless steel]] was invented by [[Harry Brearley]] in 1912, bringing affordable [[cutlery]] to the masses.<ref name="Steel BBC" /><ref></ref> The work of [[Frederick Brian Pickering|F. B. Pickering]] and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels.<ref></ref> Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the [[Advanced Manufacturing Park]], situated just over the boundary in the borough of Rotherham, by Sheffield's universities and other independent research organisations.<ref></ref> Organisations located on the AMP include the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between the [[Boeing Company]] and the [[University of Sheffield]]), Castings Technology International (CTI), [[The Welding Institute]] (TWI),<ref></ref> [[Rolls-Royce plc]] and [[McLaren Automotive]].

[[Sheffield Forgemasters|Forgemasters]], founded in 1805, is the sole remaining independent [[steel works]] in the world and dominates the north-east of Sheffield around the [[Lower Don Valley]].<ref></ref> The firm has a global reputation for producing the largest and most complex steel forgings and castings and is certified to produce critical nuclear components, with recent projects including the [[Royal Navy]]'s  submarines.<ref></ref> The firm also has the capacity for pouring the largest single ingot (570 tonnes) in Europe and is currently in the process of expanding its capabilities.<ref></ref>

While iron and steel have long been the main industries of Sheffield, [[coal mining]] has also been a major industry, particularly in the outlying areas, and the [[Palace of Westminster]] in London was built using [[limestone]] from [[quarry|quarries]] in the nearby village of [[Anston]]. Other areas of employment include [[call centre]]s, the [[City Council]], universities and hospitals.

=== Public sector ===
[[File:Diamond UoS 2 26 May 2017.jpg|thumb|right|alt=University of Sheffield Diamond|''The Diamond'', at the [[University of Sheffield]]. The university is a major public sector employer in the city]]
Sheffield has a large public sector workforce, numbering 77,500 workers. During the period 1995 – 2008 (a period of growth for the city and many others in the UK), the number of jobs in the city increased by 22% and 50% of these were in the public sector.<ref></ref> Major public sector employers include the [[National Health Service]], [[The University of Sheffield]], [[Sheffield Hallam University]], and numerous government departments and agencies including the [[Home Office]] (Visas & Immigration), [[Department for Education]] & [[Department for Business, Innovation & Skills]]. Recently developed offices in St Paul's Place and [[Riverside Exchange]] play host to the aforementioned government departments.

[[Sheffield City Council]], which is also a major public sector employer in the city, employs over 8,000 people, spread across four different sections (known as portfolios). Sheffield City Council is also the [[Local Education Authority]] (LEA) and as such manages all states schools and their associated staff. As part of its mandate to provide public services, Sheffield City Council maintains contracts with three private contractors - [[Amey plc|Amey]], [[Veolia]] & [[Capita]] (contract ending in 2020). Together, these contractors provide additional employment in the city.

=== Retail ===
[[File:SheffieldCitySkyline.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An aerial view of Sheffield City Centre|A view of [[Sheffield City Centre]]. Some of the major shopping precincts can be seen in the left and centre of the image.]]
[[File:Fargate, Sheffield (2).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Fargate, Sheffield|[[Fargate]] shopping precinct]]
Sheffield is a major retail centre, and is home to many [[High Street]] and [[department store]]s as well as designer boutiques.<ref></ref> The main shopping areas in the city centre are on [[The Moor Quarter|The Moor]] precinct, [[Fargate]], [[Orchard Square]] and the [[Devonshire Quarter]]. Department stores in the city centre include [[Marks and Spencer]] and [[Atkinsons]]. Sheffield's main market was once [[Castle Market]], built above the remains of the castle. This has since been demolished.<ref></ref> [[The Moor Quarter#Moor Market|Sheffield Moor Market]] opened in 2013 and became the main destination for fresh produce. The market has 196 stalls and includes local and organic produce, as well as international fusion cuisine such as Russian, Jamaican and Thai.<ref></ref> In March 2021 it was announced that the Sheffield branch of [[John Lewis & Partners|John Lewis]] would close due to falling sales and a move to online shopping, which had increased because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]]. John Lewis received £3&nbsp;million of public funding from Sheffield city council in 2020 to keep the local store open.<ref></ref> The local [[Debenhams]] branches are expected to re-open ofter the lifting of the 2021 COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, but only to clear existing stock, after which it is expected the stores will close.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

[[Meadowhall (shopping centre)|Meadowhall]] shopping centre, located to the north of Sheffield close to the boundary with [[Rotherham]] and next to the [[M1 motorway]], is a major regional shopping destination and currently ranked [[List of shopping centres in the United Kingdom by size|eleventh largest]] in the UK with a floorspace of . Attracting over 30&nbsp;million visitors a year (up from 19&nbsp;million in its first year), the centre hosts 270&nbsp;shops, 37&nbsp;restaurants and a cinema.<ref name="ReferenceA"></ref><ref></ref> Many nationally renowned brands have a presence at the centre including [[House of Fraser]], [[Marks & Spencer]], [[Hugo Boss]] & [[Jaeger (clothing)|Jaeger]]. The centre is connected to the city centre by rail, [[Supertram (Sheffield)|Supertram]] and bus services.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Prior to the opening of Meadowhall, the site was occupied for East Hecla (steel) works, a major employer in the north east of the city. The opening of Meadowhall in 1990 marked the beginning of major rejuvenation in the [[Lower Don Valley]] as the steel industry contracted.

Other shopping areas outside the city centre include [[Ecclesall Road]] (with a strong student presence and many bars and restaurants), [[London Road (Sheffield)|London Road]] (known for its diverse demographic and cuisines), [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]], [[Firth Park]] and the [[Crystal Peaks]] shopping centre (the main shopping destination on the southeast side of the city). In a 2010 survey of forecast expenditure at retail centres in the United Kingdom, Meadowhall was ranked 12th and [[Sheffield City Centre]] 19th.<ref></ref>

With the decline in high street shopping around the UK, efforts have been made to rejuvenate Sheffield City Centre and improve the retail and leisure offering. Major developments include [[Leopold Square]], [[The Moor Quarter|The Moor]], St Paul's Place (a mixed use development) and the [[Heart of the City, Sheffield|Heart of the City]] I & II projects.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism plays a major role in the city's economy on account of numerous attractions - namely the Peak District, sports events (in particular, the [[Snooker World Championships]]) and musical festivals (such as [[Tramlines]]). In 2019, the tourism industry in Sheffield was valued at £1.36&nbsp;billion and supported 15,000 jobs.<ref></ref>

In 2012, [[Sheffield City Region Enterprise Zone]] was launched to promote development in a number of sites in Sheffield and across the wider region. In March 2014 additional sites were added to the zone.<ref></ref>

==Transport==

===Road===
Motorways near the city are the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[M18 motorway (Great Britain)|M18]].<ref name="OS"></ref> [[Sheffield Parkway]] connects the city centre to the motorways. The M1 (a road with London at one end and [[Leeds]] on the other) skirts the city's north-east and crossing [[Tinsley Viaduct]] near Rotherham. The M18 branches from the M1 close to Sheffield, linking the city with [[Doncaster]] and ending at [[Goole]].
[[File:Sheffield Parkway.png|thumb|alt=Sheffield Parkway as viewed from Park Square, where it ends at the City Centre. In the image's centre is a six lanes road leading towards the [[Parkway Edge development]] (left-centre), where the road meets the [[Sheffield Inner Ring Road|Inner Ring Road]]. To the right is the [[Sheffield Supertram]] viaduct and beyond that a residential complex.|The [[Sheffield Parkway]] at [[Park Square, Sheffield|Park Square]], the opposite end connects to the [[M1 motorway]] at Junction 33.]]
The [[A57 road|A57]] and [[A61 road]]s are the major [[trunk road]]s through Sheffield.<ref name="OS" /> These run east–west and north–south respectively, crossing in the city centre, from where the other major roads generally radiate spoke-like. An inner [[Sheffield Inner Ring Road|ring road]], mostly constructed in the 1970s and extended in 2007 to form a complete ring,<ref></ref> allows traffic to avoid the city centre, and an [[Sheffield Outer Ring Road|outer ring road]] runs to the east, south-east and north, nearer the edge of the city, but does not serve the western side of Sheffield.<ref name="OS" />
====Bus====
[[File:Sheffield Interchange 2.png|thumb|right|alt=Sheffield bus and coach Interchange is in the foreground, in the bottom left corner is the main entrance. In the centre are long bus stands that form the interchange. Above that is the Digital Campus built upon an unused part of the interchange. In the top left corner is the 1960s Park Hill flats and to the right is Sheffield Station. |[[Sheffield Interchange]], served by [[National Express Coaches]]]]
[[Sheffield Interchange]] is the city's bus main hub; other bus stations are at [[Halfway, Sheffield|Halfway]], [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]] and [[Darnall#Meadowhall|Meadowhall]]. After deregulation in 1986,<ref></ref> they were multiple new service providers. Current providers are [[First South Yorkshire]], [[Stagecoach Yorkshire]], [[TM Travel]], [[Hulleys of Baslow]], Powells, G&J Holmes and [[Sheffield Community Transport]]. 
[[File:Wright StreetDeck Hybrid.jpg|thumb|right|A [[First South Yorkshire]] service]]
First South Yorkshire, is the largest bus operator.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The company offered [[zero-fare]] bus service until 2014, it was called the ''FreeBee'' and was a circular route around the city centre from the Sheffield Interchange.<ref></ref><ref></ref> They is also the [[Bus Rapid Transit North]] route between Sheffield and [[Maltby, South Yorkshire|Maltby]] via Rotherham. It was planNed as two routes; the Northern route to Rotherham via Meadowhall and [[Templeborough]], and the southern route via the developing employment centre and Waverley.<ref></ref> The northern route opened in September 2016, it involved a 800m Tinsley Road Link to be built between Meadowhall and the A6178 road.<ref><br/><br/></ref>

[[Yorkshire Terrier (bus company)|Yorkshire Terrier]], Andrews and the parent company [[Yorkshire Traction]] formerly operated in the city and were taken-over by [[Stagecoach Sheffield]].<ref></ref> [[Stagecoach Group]] also operates the [[sheffield Supertram|Supertram]] and has an integrated ticketing system with buses and tram.<ref>[http://www.stagecoachbus.com/tickets.aspx?action=&sid=20100826214621-5659&product_id=14&location_id=17&period_filter=any Stagecoach Bus] .

Major railway routes through [[Sheffield station]] include the [[Midland Main Line]] (to London via the East Midlands), the [[Cross Country Route]] (which goes from the East Scotland to South-west England) and the lines linking Liverpool and Manchester with  and [[East Anglia]].<ref></ref> With the redevelopment of  complete, Sheffield has a direct connection to [[continental Europe]] via the [[East Midlands Railway]] to St Pancras and the [[Eurostar]] to France and Belgium.<ref></ref> East Midlands Railway also operates three premium trains - the ''[[Master Cutler (train)|Master Cutler]]'', the ''[[Sheffield Continental]]'' and the ''[[South Yorkshireman]]''.

[[High Speed 2]] is planned to serve a city centre station in Sheffield as a spur from the main HS2 line. Proposals for the HS2 station's location have been considered; including Sheffield station,  (on the location of the former station of the same name) and [[Meadowhall Interchange]]. It is scheduled to be operational by 2033. There will befour trains an hour serving the station, with journey times to London and Birmingham reduced to 1 hour 19 minutes and 48 minutes respectively.<ref></ref> In November 2021, the UK government published the ''Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands'' in which it announced HS2's eastern spur route (between the East Midlands and Leeds) was cancelled, which had been planned to include Sheffield. The document announced upgrades to the Midland Mainline with HS2 trains able to run on this upgraded and electrified route.<ref></ref>

There are several local rail routes running along the city's valleys and beyond, connecting it with other parts of [[South Yorkshire]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Derbyshire]]. These local routes include the [[Penistone Line]], the [[Dearne Valley Line]], the [[Hope Valley Line]] and the [[Hallam Line]]. As well as the main stations of [[Sheffield Midland station|Sheffield]] and Meadowhall, there are five suburban stations, at [[Chapeltown railway station|Chapeltown]], [[Darnall railway station|Darnall]], [[Woodhouse railway station|Woodhouse]], and [[Dore & Totley railway station|Dore & Totley]].<ref></ref>
==== Trams ====
[[File:Sheffield Supertram - Tram Train 399 204 (geograph 5940823).jpg|thumb|alt=A Sheffield Supertram in current blue, orange and red Stagecoach livery. |A [[Sheffield Supertram]]]]
The [[Sheffield Supertram]] (not derived from the [[Sheffield Tramway|previous tramways]]), opened in 1994 and is operated by [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]]. The opening was shortly after the similar [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] scheme in Greater Manchester. The Supertram network consists of  of track and four lines (with all lines running via the city centre): from Halfway to [[Malin Bridge]] (Blue Line), from Meadowhall to [[Middlewood, South Yorkshire|Middlewood]] (Yellow Line), from Meadowhall to [[Herdings Park]] (Purple Line),<ref></ref> and the from [[Sheffield Cathedral|Cathedral]] to [[Rotherham Parkgate tram stop|Rotherham Parkgate]] (Black Line). The system contains both on-street and segregated running, depending upon the section and line. The Black Line opened in 2018,<ref></ref> with a "train-trams", trams able to share a line with conventional rail between Sheffield and Rotherham.
===Canal===
The [[Sheffield & South Yorkshire Navigation]] (S&SY) is a system of navigable inland waterways ([[canal]]s and canalised rivers) in Yorkshire and [[Lincolnshire]].<ref></ref> Chiefly based on the [[River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don]], it runs for a length of  and has 29&nbsp;[[canal lock|locks]]. It connects Sheffield, [[Rotherham]] and [[Doncaster]] with the [[River Trent]] at [[Keadby]] and (via the [[New Junction Canal]]) the [[Aire & Calder Navigation]].<ref></ref>

===Air===
[[File:Robin Hood Airport (3 of 7) - geograph.org.uk - 449841.jpg|thumb|[[Doncaster Sheffield Airport]]]]
Following the closure of [[Sheffield City Airport]] in 2008,<ref></ref> the closest international airport to Sheffield is [[Doncaster Sheffield Airport]] which is located  from the city centre. It opened on 28 April 2005 on the former [[RAF Finningley]] site and is served mainly by charter and budget airlines, with about one million passengers a year.<ref></ref> A link road, called the Great Yorkshire Way, connects Doncaster Sheffield Airport to the M18 motorway, reducing the journey time from Sheffield city centre from 40 to 25 minutes.<ref></ref>

[[East Midlands Airport]] is within an hour's drive of the city, [[Manchester Airport]] has a direct service hourly by [[South TransPennine]]. [[Leeds Bradford]] and [[Humberside Airport|Humberside]] are also nearby airports.

===Cycling===
Although hilly, Sheffield is compact and has few major trunk roads, therefore [[cycling in South Yorkshire|cycling in Sheffield]] is a popular method of transport. It is on the [[Trans-Pennine Trail]], a [[National Cycle Network]] route running from West to East from [[Southport]] in Merseyside to [[Hornsea]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] and North to South from [[Leeds]] in West Yorkshire to [[Chesterfield, Derbyshire|Chesterfield]] in Derbyshire.<ref></ref> There are many cycle routes going along country paths in the woods surrounding the city, and an increasing number of cycle lanes in the city itself.

==Education==


[[File:Sheffield Uni.jpg|thumb|alt=Red brick university building|[[Firth Court]], the administrative and ceremonial centre of the [[University of Sheffield]]]]
[[File:Sheffield City Centre and station.jpg|thumb|[[Sheffield Hallam University]] city campus seen from South Street Park]]
Within the city of Sheffield there are two universities, 141 primary schools and 28 secondary schools.<ref></ref>

===Universities and colleges===

Sheffield has two universities, the [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. The two combined bring about 60,000&nbsp;students to the city every year.<ref name="HESA citation"></ref>

The University of Sheffield is the city's oldest university. It was established in 1897 as University College Sheffield and gained university status in 1905. Its history traces back to Sheffield Medical School found in 1828, Firth College in 1879 and Sheffield Technical School in 1884. The university is one of the original [[red brick universities]] and is a member of the [[Russell Group]].

Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) is a university on two sites in Sheffield. City Campus is located in the city centre, close to Sheffield railway station, and [[Collegiate Crescent]] Campus is about  away, adjacent to [[Ecclesall Road]] in south-west Sheffield. Sheffield Hallam University's history goes back to 1843 with the establishment of the Sheffield School of Design. During the 1960s several independent colleges (including the School of Design) joined to become Sheffield Polytechnic (Sheffield City Polytechnic from 1976) and was finally renamed Sheffield Hallam University in 1992.

Sheffield has three main [[further education]] providers: [[The Sheffield College]], [[Longley Park Sixth Form]] and [[Chapeltown Academy]]. [[The Sheffield College]] is organised on a federal basis and was originally created from the merger of six colleges around the city: Sheffield City (formerly Castle),<ref></ref> Olive Grove and Eyre Street near the city centre, Hillsborough and Fir Vale, serving the north of the city and Peaks to the south.<ref></ref>

===Secondary, primary and pre-school education===

There are 137&nbsp;primary schools, 26&nbsp;secondary schools – of which 10 have [[sixth form]]s: ([[High Storrs School (Sheffield)|High Storrs]], [[King Ecgbert School|King Ecgberts]], [[King Edward VII School (Sheffield)|King Edward VII]], [[Silverdale School (Sheffield)|Silverdale]], [[Meadowhead School|Meadowhead]], [[Tapton School|Tapton]], [[Notre Dame School (Sheffield)|Notre Dame Catholic High]] and [[All Saints Catholic High School, Sheffield|All Saints Catholic High]]<ref></ref>) – and a sixth-form college, [[Longley Park Sixth Form]].<ref></ref> The city's five independent private schools include [[Birkdale School]] and the [[Sheffield High School (South Yorkshire)|Sheffield High School]].<ref></ref> There are also 12 special schools and a number of Integrated Resource Units in mainstream schools which are, along with all other schools, managed by Sheffield City Council.<ref name="sheffield2010">[http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/education/our-schools/school-information#typesofschools] </ref> All schools are non-selective, mixed sex schools (apart from [[Sheffield High School, South Yorkshire|Sheffield High School]] which is an all-girls school).<ref name="sheffield2010" />
The Early Years Education and Childcare Service of Sheffield City Council manages 32 nurseries and children's centres in the city.<ref name="sheffield2010" />

=== University Technical Colleges (UTCs) ===
Launched by the [[Coalition Government 2010-2015|coalition government]] in 2010, the [[University Technical College]] program was designed to foster greater interest in [[STEM]] subjects amongst students aged 14 to 18. Sheffield currently hosts two UTCs, [[UTC Sheffield City Centre]] and [[UTC Sheffield Olympic Legacy Park]]. All UTCs, including those in Sheffield, are sponsored by the Baker Dearing Educational Trust,<ref name="bakertrust"></ref> established by [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Lord Baker]]. The two UTCs in Sheffield are also sponsored and supported by [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. Whilst the UTCs are equivalent to regular secondary schools and sixth forms, their governance structure and curriculum are different, owing to their status as free schools and focusing on STEM, as opposed to a broader curriculum.

==Religion==

Sheffield is home to a centre of multicultural events, institutions, and places of worship. Some of the city's most notable buildings include its main [[Church of England]] [[Diocese of Sheffield]]'s [[Sheffield Cathedral|cathedral]] on Church Street and the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Diocese of Hallam]]'s [[Cathedral Church of St Marie, Sheffield|cathedral]] on Norfolk Row. 

The city also has other churches including [[St Vincent's Church, Sheffield|St Vincent's Church]], [[St Matthew's Church, Sheffield|St Matthew's Church]], [[St Paul's Church, Wordsworth Avenue|St Paul's Church]], [[St Paul's Church and Centre, Norton Lees, Sheffield|St Paul's Church and Centre]], [[Victoria Hall, Sheffield|Victoria Hall]] and [[Christ Church, Fulwood, Sheffield|Christ Church]].

====Football codes====
[[File:Bramall Lane End.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bramall Lane]], the home of [[Sheffield United FC|Sheffield United]], is close to the city centre.]][[File:Hillsborough Stadium interior.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]], the home of [[Sheffield Wednesday FC|Sheffield Wednesday]], is the city's largest stadium with a capacity of just under 40,000.]]
Sheffield has a long sporting heritage. In 1857 a collective of [[cricket]]ers formed the world's first-ever official [[association football|football]] club, [[Sheffield FC]],<ref></ref> and the world's second-ever, [[Hallam FC]], who also play at the [[Sandygate Road|world's oldest football ground]]<ref></ref> in the suburb of [[Crosspool]]. Sheffield and Hallam are today Sheffield's two major non-league sides, although Sheffield now play just outside the city in nearby [[Dronfield]], Derbyshire. Sheffield and Hallam contest what has become known as the Sheffield derby. By 1860 there were 15&nbsp;football clubs in Sheffield, with the first ever amateur league and cup competitions taking place in the city.<ref></ref>

Sheffield is best known for its two professional football teams, [[Sheffield United FC|Sheffield United]], nicknamed ''The Blades'', and [[Sheffield Wednesday FC|Sheffield Wednesday]], nicknamed [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.#Nickname|''The Owls'']]. United, who play at [[Bramall Lane]] south of the city centre, compete in the [[Premier League]] and Wednesday, who play at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] in the north-west of the city, compete in the [[Football League Championship]]. The two clubs contest the [[Steel City Derby]], which is considered by many to be one of the most fierce football rivalries in English Football.<ref></ref>

In the pre-war era, both Wednesday and United enjoyed large amounts of success and found themselves two of the country's top clubs; Sheffield Wednesday have been champions of the Football League four times – in [[1902–03 Football League|1902–03]], [[1903-04 Football League|1903–04]], [[1928-29 Football League|1928–29]] and [[1929-30 Football League|1929–30]], whilst Sheffield United have won it once, in [[1897-98 Football League|1897–98]]. During the 1970s and early 1980s the two sides fell from grace, with Wednesday finding themselves in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] by the mid-70s and United as far as the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in [[1980-81 in English football|1981]]. Wednesday once again became one of England's high-flying clubs following promotion back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in [[1983-84 in English football|1984]], winning the [[1991 Football League Cup Final|League Cup in 1991]], competing in the [[1992–93 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup in 1992–93]], and reaching the final of both the [[1993 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] and [[1993 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]] in the [[1992-93 in English football|same season]].

United and Wednesday were both founding members of the [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] in 1992, but The Blades were relegated in [[1993-94 in English football|1994]]. The Owls remained until [[1999-00 in English football|2000]]. Both clubs had gone into decline in the 21st&nbsp; century, Wednesday twice relegated to [[Football League One|League One]] and United suffering the same fate in [[2010-11 in English football|2011]], despite a brief spell in the Premier League in [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07]]. United was promoted to the Premier League in 2019 under manager, and Sheffield United Fan, Chris Wilder. Despite being written off by most football pundits, and declared favourites for relegation from the Premier League, United exceeded expectations and finished in the top half of the table in the 2019–20 season. In the 2020-2021 season, United sat at the bottom of the Premier League table by the conclusion of the season and were relegated.

Sheffield was the site of the deadliest sports venue disaster in the United Kingdom, the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in 1989, when 97 [[Liverpool FC|Liverpool]] supporters were killed in a stampede and crush during an [[FA Cup]] semi-final at the venue.

[[Rotherham United FC|Rotherham United]], who play in the Championship, did play their home games in the city between 2008 and 2012, having moved to play at Sheffield's [[Don Valley Stadium]] in 2008 following a dispute with their previous landlord at their traditional home ground of [[Millmoor]], Rotherham. However, in July 2012, the club moved to the new 12,000 seat [[New York Stadium]] in Rotherham. There are also facilities for golf, [[climbing]] and bowling, as well as a newly inaugurated national ice-skating arena ([[IceSheffield]]).

[[Sheffield Eagles]] RLFC are the city's professional [[rugby league]] team who play their matches at [[Owlerton Stadium]]. They currently play in the second tier of the professional league, the [[Co-operative Championship|Championship]] and are current champions, having won back to back titles in 2012 and 2013. Their most successful moment came in 1998, when, against all the odds they defeated [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] in the Challenge Cup final, despite being huge underdogs. The team then hit troubled times before reforming in 2003. Since then they have played their rugby in the Championship (second tier). In 2011, they made the playoffs finishing in fifth place. They made the Grand Final, by defeating [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]], who were huge favourites in a playoff semi final. In the final, they were comprehensively beaten by [[Featherstone Rovers]]. Sheffield also put in a bid to be a host city for the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup]], but their bid was unsuccessful.

The tradition of singing carols in pubs around Christmas is still kept alive in the city. The Sheffield Carols, as they are known locally, predate modern carols by over a century and are sung with alternative words and verses.<ref></ref> Although there is a core of carols that are sung at most venues, each particular place has its own mini-tradition. The repertoire at two nearby places can vary widely, and woe betide those who try to strike up a ‘foreign’ carol. Some are unaccompanied, some have a piano or organ, there is a flip chart with the words on in one place, a string quartet (quintet, sextet, septet) accompanies the singing at another, some encourage soloists, others stick to audience participation, a brass band plays at certain events, the choir takes the lead at another.<ref></ref> It is thought this tradition is now unique in Britain.

The city is home to thirteen [[morris dance]] teams – thought to be one of the highest concentration of sides in the country. Nearly all forms of the dance are represented in the city, including [[Cotswold morris|Cotswold]] (Five Rivers Morris,<ref></ref> Pecsaetan Morris,<ref></ref> Harthill Morris,<ref></ref> Lord Conyer's Morris Men,<ref></ref> Sheffield City Morris,<ref></ref> William Morris<ref></ref>), [[Border Morris|border]] (Boggart's Breakfast<ref></ref>), [[North West morris|North West]] (Yorkshire Chandelier,<ref></ref> Silkstone Greens,<ref></ref> Lizzie Dripping<ref></ref>), [[Rapper dance|rapper]] (Sheffield Steel Rapper<ref></ref>) and [[Long Sword dance|Yorkshire Longsword]].
